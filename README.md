Crater - A simple setlist management tool for DJs
======

With this project my aim is to get to grips with PHP frameworks (namely CakePHP), front-end frameworks (Bootstrap), TDD and best design practices. While making a semi-useful application!

The first version of Crater will let users:
- input track information into a setlist
- rearrange tracks within the setlist
- add a master BPM to the setlist and have Crater automatically calculate individual track's new keys for harmonic mixing

Features I'd like to add:
- enable users to upload files directly and have Crater fill out data through the file's ID3 tags
- suggest an optimal track order for harmonic mixing
- allow for BPM and key changes within individual tracks

The public server will be available at http://crater.sblorgh.org/ once the basic features are in place.
